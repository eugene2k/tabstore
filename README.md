# tabstore
A webextension for Firefox

This extension lets the user bookmark and close the tabs they wish to view later, so as
not to clutter up the tab bar or slow down the browser. The bookmarked tabs can be later opened,
which will automatically remove them from the store. In addition, the tab store can be synchronized with Pocket.
